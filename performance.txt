Decryption: 104 clock cycles from assertion of ciphertext_valid to assertion of data_ready
Total: 240 clock cycles for encryption/decryption with new key, 104 if using previously expanded key
AES-192:
Key expansion: 128 clock cycles from assertion of key_valid to assertion of key_ready
Encryption: 124 clock cycles from assertion of data_valid to assertion of ciphertext_ready
Decryption: 124 clock cycles from assertion of ciphertext_valid to assertion of data_ready
Total: 252 clock cycles for encryption/decryption with new key, 124 if using previously expanded key
AES-256:
Key expansion: 164 clock cycles from assertion of key_valid to assertion of key_ready
Encryption: 144 clock cycles from assertion of data_valid to assertion of ciphertext_ready
Decryption: 144 clock cycles from assertion of ciphertext_valid to assertion of data_ready
Total: 308 clock cycles for encryption/decryption with new key, 144 if using previously expanded key
Hardware:
2959 registers, 2863 ALMs, 2048 BRAM bits (SBOX), 143.99 MHz maximum frequency from a typical run

Simplex XTEA (single encryption/decryption core) with no subkey storage:
Simulation test:
Encryption: 134 clock cycles from assertion of key_data_valid to assertion of data_ready
Decryption: 134 clock cycles from assertion of key_data_valid to assertion of data_ready
Note key expansion is redone for every encryption/decryption to reduce area, can be sped up by storing subkeys
Hardware:
559 registers, 370 ALMs, 0 BRAM bits, 134.79 MHz maximum frequency from a typical run

Duplex XTEA (seperate encryption/decryption cores) with subkey storage:
Simulation test:
Key expansion: 69 clock cycles from assertion of key_valid to assertion of key_ready
Encryption: 70 clock cycles from assertion of data_valid to assertion of ciphertext_ready
Decryption: 70 clock cycles from assertion of ciphertext_valid to assertion of data_ready
Total: 139 clock cycles for encryption/decryption with new key, 70 if using previously expanded key
Hardware:
3073 registers, 2311 ALMs, 0 BRAM bits, 128.82 MHz maximum frequency from a typical run

Optimised duplex XTEA (seperate encryption/decryption cores) without subkey storage:
Simulation test:
Encryption: 70 clock cycles from assertion of data_valid to assertion of ciphertext_ready
Decryption: 70 clock cycles from assertion of ciphertext_valid to assertion of data_ready
Key expansion done in parallel with encryption/decryption on the fly along with other performance optimisations
Hardware:
878 registers, 769 ALMs, 0 BRAM bits, 125.64 MHz maximum frequency from a typical run


General notes:
- FPGA to use: Cyclone V 5CEBA9F31C8
- Duplex XTEA much faster when using same key, capable of running at similar Fmax on hardware, capable of performing simultaneous encryption/decryption.
- Simplex XTEA slightly faster when using new key every time (probably not common use case), significantly less hardware resources.
- Duplex XTEA without key storage offers best of both; simultaneous encryption/decryption, same speed as with key storage wether new key used or not,
  much lighter on hardware resources than with key storage.
