General notes:
- Original duplex XTEA much faster when using same key, capable of running at similar Fmax on hardware, capable of performing simultaneous encryption/decryption.
- Original simplex XTEA slightly faster when using new key every time (probably not common use case), significantly less hardware resources.
- Optimised duplex XTEA without key storage offers best of both; simultaneous encryption/decryption, same speed as with key storage whether new key used or not,
  much lighter on hardware resources than with key storage.
- Optimised simplex XTEA without key storage performs identically to optimised duplex XTEA, tradeoff between ability to run in duplex and hardware resources required.
