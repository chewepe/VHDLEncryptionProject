Duplex AES (seperate encryption/decryption cores):
Simulation test:
Key expansion: 136 clock cycles from assertion of key_in_flag to assertion of key_ready_flag
Encryption: 104 clock cycles from assertion of plaintext_in_flag to assertion of ciphertext_out_flag
Decryption: 104 clock cycles from assertion of ciphertext_in_flag to assertion of plaintext_out_flag
Total: 240 clock cycles for encryption/decryption with new key, 104 if using previously expanded key
Hardware:
3013 registers, 2846 ALMs, 2048 BRAM bits, 133.44 MHz maximum frequency from a typical run

Simplex XTEA (single encryption/decryption core) with no subkey storage:
Simulation test:
Encryption: 166 clock cycles from assertion of key_data_in_flag to assertion of output_data_flag
Decryption: 166 clock cycles from assertion of key_data_in_flag to assertion of output_data_flag
Note key expansion is redone for every encryption/decryption to reduce area, can be sped up by storing subkeys
Hardware:
560 registers, 364 ALMs, 0 BRAM bits, 125.6 MHz maximum frequency from a typical run
